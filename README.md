ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Prokope45 (or just Jared), and I'm a student studying Integrated Computer Science at Kansas State University. I hold an AAS in Software Development, and my information technology interests include server/cloud development, web development, Linux terminal and server management, and mobile application development. 

If you would like to collaborate with me, you can reach me at my email at ğŸ“«JPaubel@pm.meğŸ“«!
